The objective was to implement and deliver a computer-based system that can handle a large part of an airway company’s enterprise. More specifically, the system was required to store data with regards to planes, flight and passengers during the company’s years of operation. 
The company itself possesses two different types of aircraft; the ‘P62’ and ‘P124 planes’, with the former having a rectangular seating-arrangement of 6x2 and the latter having a rectangular seating-arrangement of 12x4.
The sources and destinations of available flights were to be allocated from a specific set of city airports, which could then be expanded to include more flight options in the future if necessary.
